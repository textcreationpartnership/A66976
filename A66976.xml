            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Now ſo often as the Teachers of new and ſtrange Doctrines come into the world, profeſſing oppoſition to thoſe received from our preſent Superiours, and to the common tenents of the Church, Chriſtians are directed by St. <hi>John</hi> c. 4. v. 1. <hi>to try ſuch Spirits whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of God.</hi> —And are inſtructed, by our Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.16. <hi>that they ſhall know and diſcern them by their fruits;</hi> and then, by the Apoſtles (as you have ſeen) what in particular theſe <hi>fruits</hi> are.</p>

The ſame allegation is alſo againſt Matrimony, againſt Houſe-laws, and Temporal Government. We ſee that our Saviour Chriſt (when he was here on earth) led no ſuch ſolitary kind of life, he was not much alone; there was always a tumult of many people about him; he was never alone but when he prayed.

See before §. 11. <hi>n.</hi> 1. —And the remedy he uſed for things that troubled him within, he applied alſo to the things that afflicted him abroad; any Doctrines contrary to his own, tho of his Fellow-Reformiſts, he pronounced them all Doctrines of the Devil; and was pleaſed to fancy the authors of them no better than perſons poſſeſſed, <hi>Sathanizati,</hi> as he called them, which hath bin hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (§. 25.—31. <hi>n.</hi> 1.) his Polemical writings being everywhere full of this terrible name, <hi>Devil,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles are noted for the frequency of the ſaving name, <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Now this indeed, <hi>viz. that that which troubles us comes from the Devil,</hi> were it true, affords a man the greateſt conſolation that can be: for he preſently ſtops his cars, makes reſiſtance, believes nothing hereof, as being ſpoken by the Father of Lyes; the ſtronglier he is oppoſed, the greater Saint he takes himſelf to be; the more he is charged, the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; and finally the friend, and beloved of God, becauſe the Devil is his enemy, and impugnes him. And the Devil ſpreads no net, with which he catcheth ſo many, as this; to make men mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the chaſtiſement or the juſtice of God, for the malice and perſecutions of the Devil; the truth of God, for the illuſions and lies of the Devil; the motions and admonitions of the Spirit of God, or of their own conſcience, or alſo of their friends to amend and reform them, for the external, or internal ſuggeſtions of the Devil to pervert and diſcourage them. Therefore perhaps it will not be amiſs here to ſift this matter a little more narrowly; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I am afraid this poor man was moſt miſerably couzened, and deceived by that moſt ſubtle adverſary.</p>

So when our own Conſcience, not yet quite ſeared, and hardned, or alſo God's Holy Spirit, brings our former life, or our preſent practices before us to produce our amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to caſt us into a wholſom ſadneſs, or melancholly, and grief, not to be grieved for; we may father this on the Devil, (ſince all theſe things are acted only in the Soul,) as endevouring to reduce us to deſpair, and to diſhearten our faith in Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, when as the Devil's temptation at the very ſame time is another quite contrary; and not the ſadneſs, but the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that this ſadneſs is wrought by him; and the haſte that they are prompted to, to diſpatch it away, and ſhake their hands of it, as coming from him, is the only thing that comes from him; only the apprehenſion, I ſay, <hi>that it is from the Devil,</hi> is from the Devil. And there being two things, which he labours to effect, the one to reduce us by any means into an evil condition; and the other to breed in us a ſecurity in ſuch condition: this way he takes, in our flying from the net of deſpair, which we think is ſpread before us, to drive us into another ſnare of preſumption, in our thinking that our life is righteous, and holy, when it is not; or Chriſt's merits apply'd to us by faith without ſuch holineſs, and performing the Covenant of the Goſpel, when they are not; and when Godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and compunction comes to work in us what is defective, and reform what is amiſs, the Devil begets this fancy in us, that it is the Devil, that by this ſadneſs would plunge us into melancholy, and deſpair; and ſo ſtraight we labour to divert our thoughts, and to encourage our ſelves in our former courſes; and we borrow of the Devil theſe wings to fly from him, which carry us juſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way.</p>

Here then he often ſpeaketh to them the plain truth, and which they know to be ſo, thereby to diſcompoſe, and diſhearten, and drive them into diſpair. So he urgeth the Scriptures to us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt paſt ſins, but always with ſome falſe gloſs annexed. Such was the temptation that <hi>Luther</hi> (but miſtaken) apprehended in the Devil's diſputation with him about the Maſs. Here alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he urgeth truth to us, as truth; by this to continue us more firm, whilſt we give no credit to him in a contary error: for ſince we know him for the Father of lies, and know it alſo to be his voice, who would not embrace the contrary ſtill to what he perſwades, or argues for, and do juſt the oppoſite to what he counſels? As if the Devil known and diſcovered ſhould tell <hi>Luther,</hi> that his Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a moſt wicked act, and that infinite of Souls ſhould be eternally ruin'd thereby, who can think but that <hi>Luther</hi> from hence would remain much confirmed, that his act was good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Devil diſparaged it; and ſo the Devil, to overſhoot him, accordingly tells him, that his Reformation was evil, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſchiefs it had done <hi>&amp;c.</hi> i. e. tells him a truth, ſo to make him think it good, and more fix him in his error. This ſtratagem Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> is willing to acknowledg in the Devil, <hi>in his oppoſing ſo ſtrongly the Maſs, as he thus imagining to keep</hi> Luther <hi>the cloſer to it;</hi> but then that <hi>Luther</hi> was here too hard from him, and out-witted him, yeilding to his arguments, and the truths he propoſed; and proſecuting them, for this, the more eagerly. Sometime again here he urgeth our own preſent errors to us as truths, becauſe we
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106352:39"/>already take them to be ſo; or he alſo further confirms them to us, if need be, with arguments of his own; hereby to drive us into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, when we are conſcious that our former actions have bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our preſent perſwaſions. Nay yet further (for who can diſcover all the ſubtle windings of that old Serpent?) he inſinuates, and confirms ſuch an error to us for truth, and pretends thereby to caſt us into deſpair, when as he intends only by ſuch proofs and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments the more to eſtabliſh us in ſuch errors, and in our proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them, that ſo we may expiate our former actions againſt them. Thus the Devil ſeems indeed to have miniſtred arguments to <hi>Luther,</hi> in that famous conference of his againſt the Maſs; ſuch as he ſaw alſo would ſway him, the more to miſ-perſwade <hi>Luther,</hi> that the Maſs was unlawful; whilſt <hi>Luther</hi> apprehended, that the Devil did this only to perſwade him, ſeeing the Maſs was clearly unlawful, that he had formerly for many years in uſing it, incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a moſt horrid ſin, for which God's Juſtice would never pardon him. Thus the Devil uſeth to repreſent to us the former good we have done, as evil; the former faith and truth we have held, and maintained, as error, or idolatry, or blaſphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeeking many times thereby to beget, in good people alſo as well as bad, a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God. Here therefore all ought to be ſuſpected that he ſaith, all his proofs well weighed; and tho when God, and our own conſcience, or our friends accuſe us of our ſins, it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable humility in us to be moſt ready to confeſs them; yet when the Devil will make us a roll of them, it is no ſuch vertue here to confeſs them ſuch, becauſe he calls them ſo, or truſt him with ſuch an office; for if we do, he will throw into the account all our virtues too, and require repentance and reformation for our good works. Therefore in the aſſaults of this enemy, as we are to fence our ſelves, for things ill done, from deſpair by God's mercy and Chriſt's merits: ſo are we very warily to examine, whether the actions he blames have incurred God's diſpleaſure, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally faulty.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106352:40"/>regrets he felt within himſelf touching his Reformation, that theſe were Satan's ſuggeſtions, and temptations, only thereby to make him deſpair, or deſert truth. For why might not this imagination rather be from Satan, and this regret from a relenting Conſcience, or God's Holy Spirit? And ſtrange it is, how he makes the Devil here blow both hot, and cold; for, when he was as yet in the boſom of the Church, then the Devil objected groſs errors to him, and by his Arguments diſputed him into a Reformation: and when gone out of the Church, and having ſo Reformed, it muſt be the Devil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that, with terrifying his conſcience, and telling him, that his new Doctrines had undone the world, endeavours to drive him back again, and make him undoe his former work. But if he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the later of theſe attempts of Satan, that becauſe this Fiend would perſwade him his Reformation was full of guilt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was juſt and right; why in his former attempts concluded he not, That becauſe the Devil oppoſed his ſaying Maſs, and ſuch other things, therefore he rightly performed them?</p>
                  <p>Neither is this any ſure argument of <hi>Luther's</hi> not being deceived by him, <hi>viz.</hi> his frequent railing, and inveighing againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; his diſcovering, and ſlighting of his arts and wiles; his vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and triumphing over him, as a routed and vanquiſhed enemy. (See <hi>§.</hi> 32.) (Whoſe ſubtleties holy men uſe to ſpeak of with much more modeſty, and fear of being deceived.) For (as I have ſaid before <hi>§.</hi> 35.) none rail more at the Devil, than the Devil will do for his own advantages; nor profeſs a greater hatred of him, or be more ready (but this is a greater plot) to diſcover his plots. In fine then, in the great uncertainty of the Author of the ſeveral thoughts and ſcruples that do ariſe within us, and in ſuch variety and diſagreeing ſhapes of Satan's ſuggeſtions and temptations, I know no ſafe-gard for <hi>Luther,</hi> or any other, to ſtand upon, but this; to be ſure not to be gotten out of the Circle (which incloſeth all Catholicks) of their obedience to their Superiours; and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject their own <hi>private</hi> holy Spirit (if I or they may ſo call it) to the <hi>publick</hi> Holy Spirit, that dwells in God's Church; and to entertain no private ſenſes, and expoſitions of God's Word, contrary to the general one of the Church, from whomſoever theſe ſingular ſenſes come; much leſſe when they know they come from Satan.

There ſeems great evidence from this diſputation, that the whole plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of the Reformation (be Satan's deſign therein what it will, He deceiving <hi>Luther,</hi> or deceived himſelf) proceeded originally from the Devil.

                     <q>Some time ſince, about midnight I chanc'd to awake out of ſleep, and behold the Devil (as he had known well enough how to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion me many troubleſome and reſtleſs nights) began a diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with me in my interior ſoul. Doſt thou hear, ſaid he, moſt Excellent Doctor? Can you be ignorant, that you alſo for fifteen years together have almoſt daily celebrated Private Maſſes? what if in thoſe Maſſes you have practiſed down-right Idolatry in ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring there, and exhibiting to others to be ador'd, not the body and blood of Chriſt, but the naked bread and wine?

I am certainly a Prieſt conſecrated to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly function [<hi>of offering the body of Chriſt,</hi>] having long ago received both Chriſm and Conſecration from a true Biſhop. Beſides, all this I did by the command of my Superiors in due obedience to them. Why might not I therefore in celebrating thoſe Maſſes be ſaid truly to conſecrate, when with all poſſible care I pronounced the very words [<hi>of Conſecration</hi>] in the greateſt devotion I was able? —You ſay very true, (anſwered the Devil), but even <hi>Turks</hi> and all Heathens perform what they do in their Temples as by command, and with a ſedulous devotion. So <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> Prieſts acted all things with a conſtant zeal and fervour, tho contrary to the true Prieſts at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> What if your Ordination and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration alſo ſhould be falſe, as amongſt the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> falſe Prieſts, falſe and impious worſhip?</q> [<hi>As yet</hi> Luther<hi>'s Ordination is questioned by Satan as falſe, but not proved.</hi>] Satan then proceeds to give theſe Reaſons thereof.</p>

So at the firſt he did not caſt off all obedience to his Superiours, or intended it, (as himſelf often profeſſeth,) nor yet intended at the firſt a Reformation of the Church's doctrines in ſo many points as he invaded afterward, but ſome amendment in manners rather; and afterward, when time and company had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened him to do this, yet he ſtill ſupported ſuch fact with this pious intention, that he did it for defending the truth; and that he only diſobeyed his other Superiours to obey God the Supreme. Neither is it likely, that he ever intended by his preaching down he Evangelical Counſels of perfection, the three vows of Religion, Sacramental Confeſſion, Penances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to introduce ſuch a licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of life as he ſaw afterwards followed upon it: nor by his throwing off the yoke of authority, to lay the open for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sects, as he ſaw crowded in ſuddenly after it, beſides his own. Such might be the Devil's deſigns from the firſt, but not <hi>Luther's;</hi> and had <hi>Satan</hi> pulled off his Mask, and diſcovered to <hi>Luther</hi> at the beginning all the evil he meant to make of him, or introduce by him; doubtleſs this man would have ſtartled, and recoiled; and this ſubtle enemies plots are ſooften ſpoiled and fruſtrated, as they are fully diſcovered.</p>

For if this Spirit be of God, the Apoſtle hath told us, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22.) that the <hi>fruits</hi> thereof <hi>are love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, continency,</hi> or <hi>temperance:</hi> if of the fleſh, and Satan; the <hi>works</hi> or fruits are <hi>fornication, uncleanneſs, laſciviouſneſs, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, revellings, hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, ſtrife, ſedition, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyings,</hi> &amp;c. Now Chriſtians, having once diſcerned thus by theſe fruits the Spirit of the Teachers, where they have ground of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that it is a bad one, have all reaſon to ſuſpect his doctrine, and his reaſons, and arguments, and his expoſitions of God's word in confirmation thereof to be ſo too. <hi>To be ſo too,</hi> I ſay, where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Church doth not authorize and ſecure ſuch doctrine to them; for the Scriptures are of <hi>no private interpretation,</hi> i. e. not of every private man's interpretation out of his own brain; becauſe they are dictated by the Holy Ghoſt; and by the Holy Ghoſt, the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt in them can only be expounded. By the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> I ſay, either in the private Expoſitor, or the Church; in which the Spirit of God for ever reſides, and guides it into all truth; from which Church he muſt learn ſuch Expoſition, or with which Church he will concur in it; if he learn it from God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106352:54"/>is truth, and the contrary error; and therefore is an orthodox faith ſo much laboured for, becauſe it is the foundation of a good life; and therefore Satan becomes the Father of all evil in us, becauſe he is firſt the Father of lyes to us. Tho then it be not here denied, but that a teacher of ſomething that is falſe, may bring forth the fruits of a good life; and contrary, the teacher of truth, the fruits of a bad: yet 1. here the fruit of good life can never proceed from the falſe doctrine taught by the one; nor the fruit of a bad life, from the truth that is taught by the other. But the teacher of truth brings forth bad fruit from his luſts carrying him againſt the truth known by him: and again, the teacher of ſome errors brings forth good fruit from the truth which he poſſeſſeth; ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led indeed with error, but yet predominative thereof. But if he be ſuch a Teacher of errors, as that the truths he holds (as none err in every thing) are, in the operation which they might have upon his manners, maſtered, and ſeduced by them; here his life alſo muſt needs be corrupt; whether he be ſuppoſed to practiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his errors, (as if he indulged ſome forbidden luſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe conceived lawful), or whether he practiſe contrary to them; for ſo he doth what is right indeed, but againſt his conſcience; all acting againſt which, tho when it errs, becomes evil. Again, if he be a teacher of ſuch errors as are expreſly condemned by the Church, or, at Jeaſt, as he knows to be ſo, whatever truths he may hold, or ſome kind of virtues practiſe according to thoſe truths, yet his life in general can never be ſtiled holy, or himſelf good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wants the two fundamental and cardinal virtues of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Humility. Laſtly, neither can a good man, teaching ſome errors, be ſo good, as if rectified in theſe, he might have bin; but that he muſt alſo be ſo far faulty, and defective in his manners, as his falſe opinion any way tendeth to the depraving and leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106352:54"/>muſt needs be more carnal, corrupt, and diſſolute lives; ſeeing that there are here both the ſame luſts warring againſt the Soul, which are alſo tempting the Catholick and Orthodox to an evil life; and moreover many groſs mis-perſwaſions and pernicious doctrines, ſiding with, and countenancing ſuch luſts, or at leaſt not curbing them. For if our luſts, even againſt knowledge, are ſo powerful over us; how ſwiftly will they move us, when our errors go along with them, and blow theſe Sails? This I ſay for the general. For as to particulars I do not deny, but that the life of ſome perſons, labouring under many erroneous principles, yet may be very regular, both by reaſon of other truths believed; which, tho this not obſerved by them, do contradict the other falſe ones, and may ſuſpend the bad influences of them upon their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; as alſo by reaſon of an extraordinary good inclination of their nature, and helps alſo of God's reſtraining grace; for even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Heathen-errors have bin ſome perſons of an external virtuous, and unreproachable converſation, and therefore much more may they be ſo amongſt any Sect of Chriſtians, who cannot but have many Catholick truths mingled with their errors; and yet much more may they be ſo amongſt ſuch reformed, as have ſince caſt off, and renounced many of <hi>Luther's</hi> more malignant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and eſpecially his <hi>Solifidian</hi> error.

The Nullity, and Antichriſtianiſm of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Eccleſiaſtical Prelacy, and Clergy, and the non-obligation of their Conſtitutions and Laws. 2. The inutility of Works, of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Mortifications, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. The Servitude of man's Will, and inability to good even in the Regenerate. 4. The ſole Sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106352:55"/>of Faith in us for our Juſtification; and this Faith an aſſurance that Chriſt's merits are applied to us in particular, and that we in particular are juſtified by them; and that every one by believing he is juſtified, truly becomes ſo. To which may be annexed his holding a parity of future glory to all juſtified, and one in Heaven as great as another, without conſideration of their own different good works, or ſufferings in this preſent life. We ſhall find in the effect, (as in reaſon it could not be otherwiſe,) That out of the firſt of theſe (the band of Eccleſiaſtical Authority being diſſolved) ſprang immediately a multitude of Sects invading one another, as well as all of them the Church, many groſs Hereſies, and grievous Schiſms, and Seditions, even ſober Proteſtants being the judges here of; all which muſt needs be accompanied with a ſtrange ſpiritual or intellectual pride, in thinking themſelves wiſer men, and better interpreters of the Scriptures than their ſpiritual Superiours, than the Doctors, Fathers, and Councils of the Church, both of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and many former ages. And that out of the three latter, (peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from them diſcovering no great utility, or neceſſity of our own, either penal or pious works) grew a great diſſoluteneſs of life on one hand, and great worldlineſs, and covetouſneſs, and its daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter oppreſſion on the other; as not believing, that the laying out of their goods here could purchaſe for them a treaſure in another place; but rather ſuch works of their own diminiſh their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Chriſt's works, and ſo ruin their Juſtification, and caſt them our of the Evangelical, into the Legal Covenant.</p>

For if aſſurance of his good eſtate be the one thing neceſſary, then nothing elſe that is diſtinct from it
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106352:55"/>(as a good life is affirmed to be) is ſo.

Nor if he be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before he amends his life, can this hinder the continuing of his Juſtification, or intercept his Salvation, if he ſhall never amend it, eſpecially, when it is ſaid by them, that the once juſtified can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be unjuſtified. Nor will this amendment and good life be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, tho not to his Juſtification, yet to the approving of it, or of his faith to himſelf, or others; becauſe his faith being a full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance includes this approbation of his Juſtification to himſelf: and the approbation of it to others muſt needs be a thing extrinſecal and impertinent to his Juſtification, nor can man's diſapproving it any way annull it. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See the Author.

Not unfrequently alſo the chief Authors of Sects and Hereſies have nothing in their life or death exorbitant, or monſtrous, or much differing from other ſorts of men. Of which perhaps one reaſon of the Divine Providence ſo diſpoſing things may be, becauſe ſeeing that it is meet that Hereſies be, ſo alſo that theſe receive no check or blaſting in their firſt growth by any extraordinary diſaſters, or judgments ſhewed upon the Founders; when-as God hath otherwiſe left evidences and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (ſuch as, I ſupoſe, are ſome of thoſe fore-mentioned in this Diſcourſe) ſufficient to deter the conſiderative and ſober from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing ſuch new Doctrines, or following ſuch Leaders.</p>

But then in marrying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore burning, perhaps he hath the gift; and ſo ſins in marrying. But if by the effect only of reſiſting, or yeilding to, a temptation, we know the gift; it follows, that none can know he wants the gift, but by (at leaſt once) ſinning, yet, to prevent which ſin none may, firſt, marry. 2. Again, how ſhall he know if he have not this gift? by burning or any one act of any uncleanneſs? 1. None can argue from not exerciſing the act of continency, that he hath not the power, (as is ſhewed before §. 9.) till he knows whether this failing proceeds from the abſence, or from his own ill manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of God's gift. For that it oft proceeds from our ill husbandry of grace, is manifeſt in many of thoſe mentioned before §. 7. who having certainly from God the power to contain, yet are many times very incontinent. If in this caſe therefore he ſhould go and marry, having the gift, but abuſing it, what <hi>thus</hi> would this be, but a multiplying of ſins, the ſin of luſt begetting the ſin of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock? 2. If thus, after any ſuch uncleanneſs, all (as being denied the gift of continency) were obliged to marry, then all, who remain not in a pure virginity, would be ſinners in a ſingle life.</p>

(1). For, firſt, were it a ſingular gift gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitally given only to ſome men; then, as we have ſhewed before, that it is neceſſary for thoſe, to whom we hold it is given as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of duty, by ſome ſigns certainly to diſcern it, for their avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin; ſo tis neceſſary alſo to theſe to whom we hold it is given as a counſel of perfection, to know it, for their endeavouring to do that which may more pleaſe God; that ſuch gracious gifts may not be beſtowed in vain, and their ſalvation ſuffer much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment; if men endeavour not, or their endeavour be not only in vain, but diſpleaſing to God, <hi>ne quis incontinentia laborans, dum coelibatum appetit, cum Deo luctetur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin;</hi> and expoſing them to ſin, if God give not.</p>
                  <p>Now the difficulties of diſcerning any ſuch thing, ſee before: yet without diſcerning which (unleſs all be capable of this gift) there can be no alacrity in our endeavours; nor will any labour to make themſelves Eunuchs. Eſpecially, when one ſees any evident ſigns, or alſo hath once felt the effects of incontinency, none ſhould dare any further to defer marriage, or any further entertain any
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106352:64"/>endeavour of attaining this gift contrary to ſuch indications of God's denial of it to him; yet is this much contrary to the practice of many holy men. (2.) There ſeems no ſufficient reaſon, to make this grace, which is converſant about the ſtrongeſt of all paſſions, and the very root of ſin; upon which depend ſo many excellent advantages in ſerving God <hi>&amp;c,</hi> (confeſs'd by all,) and granted alſo to be given to all, at all times, when the remedy of marriage cannot (as often it can not) be had; to make this grace, I ſay, when there is opportunity of marrying, then only, a gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ital grace given to ſome; others being denied it, tho never ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt after it. And thus to reſtrain this grace, only upon ſuch a pretence, becauſe tho denied the gift of continency, they have a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs way of ſatisfying their concupiſcence: when as indeed this appointed remedy of marriage (as it refers to incontinency, not to progeny) may argue only the difficulty in ſome, not the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in any, of attaining this gift; and, being inſtituted for a help of our weakneſs, ought not to be made an argument of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of God's goodneſs and bounty. Again; no reaſon, to make this grace only particular to ſome few; when as all other graces whatſoever, converſant about the like object, <hi>i. e.</hi> the moderating and ſubduing of our paſſions, are proclaimed to be general; and all men capable of them, who are not wanting to God and themſelves. So we do not ſay that any are neceſſitated to be immoderate in meat, or drink, or ſleep, in the love of riches, or honor, but, upon doing their endeavour, grace ſufficient to be given to all, to bridle the appetite, and maſter the affections; only the extremities of concupiſcence it is that we affirm ſome men are diſ-enabled upon any means whatſoever to ſuppreſs. When as mean-while it muſt be granted, that to thoſe ſingular favorites, to whom God pleaſeth to give it, it is, both gotten by means; elſe why are any ſaid to make themſelves <hi>Eunuchs?</hi> and preſerved by means: for none that have the gift (as thoſe who in marriage have their bedfellows ſick or abſent) are free from temptations, and do only by means and reſiſtance overcome them; which means experience ſhews to be powerful, not only for ſubduing luſt in men, but in the brute beaſts alſo. Whereas therefore there are two ſorts of God's gifts to us; 1. ſome to the obtaining of which is required our endeavour joyned or ſubſervient to God's both preventing and aſſiſting grace, or aid; ſuch as are <hi>Faith, Hope, Charity, Patience,</hi> &amp;c. which, tho always Gods gifts, yet may be ſaid in ſome ſenſe to be in our power alſo, in as much as we are to preſume, that God denies them to none, by his aid rightly firſt ſeeking and labouring for them. 2. Others
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106352:64"/>given <hi>gratis</hi> by him without any cooperation of ours, (tho we may alſo deſire and pray for them. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1.) Note that there is not any other of thoſe uſually called <hi>gratiae gratis datae,</hi> (which are divided to every man as the Spirit pleaſeth, mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.) any way like unto this of continency. 1. They being not conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about paſſions, or bettering our ſelves, but edifying and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting others. 1 Cor. 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 7.— 2. Not by our means procured, or conſerved, but conferred without our cooperation or endeavor; therefore we find no exhortations to the practice of them, as if they were in our power, as we find to continency: 1 Cor. 7. We find it not ſaid concerning them, <hi>There be Prophets that have made themſelves Prophets,</hi> or, —<hi>He that can receive them, let him receive them.</hi> 3. Thoſe who have them ſinning, if they be not uſed: the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of which is proved in continency. 4. Laſtly, neither is there any thing ſaid of continency, as reſtraining it to ſome particular perſon; which is not ſaid of thoſe other gifts, and graces of God of the firſt kind, as particularly of that of Faith. See 23. §. (3). Concerning the other great precepts or counſels for attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfection, as that in particular by quitting ſuperfluous riches (and ſo by this, all the cares and temptations of them,) (of which may be ſaid, what is ſaid of marrying, 1 Cor. 7.34. and <hi>v.</hi> 30, 31. compared with 29. —2 Tim. 2.4) ſo often recommended, See Matt. 19.21. preſently after the recommending of continency, <hi>v.</hi> 12. and both of them to be done for the Kingdom of Heaven. See likewiſe Lu. 12.33. Lu. 3.11.—6.35. —Matt. 5.42. —Lu. 16.9.11. —Matt. 19.29. compared 27. (where, as we muſt grant, that, tho marriage be lawful, yet the continent doth better; ſo, tho poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of riches is lawful, yet he that parts with, and beſtows, moſt of wealth ſuperfluous upon the poor, doth better, than he that keeps or ſpends more or it upon himſelf:) Concerning this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, I ſay, we do not contend, but that all are capable of receiving it: and yet our Saviour, upon occaſion of the young man's not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſo hard a ſaying, and ſo difficult a leſſon, ſeems to put the ſame difficulty in it, as in continency: for when he breaks out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, [<hi>verily I ſay a rich man ſhall hardly enter into the kingdom</hi>&amp;c. and again, <hi>Camels ſhall as eaſily be threaded thro Needles,</hi> ver. 23, 24. ſee 1 Cor. 1.26.] he ſaith only, (if we well obſerve,) It is hard for rich men to receive this ſaying, <hi>[go and ſell,] i. e.</hi> of parting with their ſuperfluous wealth. For, be this hardneſs of rich mens en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into heaven, from their truſting in their riches, or from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continual temptations of excels, and fuell for all their luſts mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by wealth; or from continual cares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diſtractions from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:106352:65"/>them, Matt. 13.22. (which alſo he names, from marriage, 1 Cor. 7.35): all is preſently remedied in receiving this ſaying, (yet foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh men take no notice of it,) <hi>ſell that ye have,</hi> [i. e. <hi>ſuperfluous,</hi>] <hi>and give it away in almes,</hi> (where the charity is not ſo much to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as to our ſelves.) For in parting with his riches, he is ſure at once to part with his truſt in them, cares, temptations of them, <hi/> for no man truſts in, or is tempted with, what he hath not. I have ſtayed the longer upon this general offer of the gift of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency on God's part; becauſe the conceit of it as of a private gift is very diſcouraging (as we ſee by their practiſes, where this doctrine is taught,) for the attempting that heavenly condition of life (ſo much recommended by our Saviour, and St. <hi>Paul</hi>) after they firſt believe, that for ſome men no means can procure it; and then, by the ſtrong aſſaults of their luſts (from which none are free) believe that themſelves are ſuch. And hence, whilſt we are in ſuſpence, whether there be a poſſibility of it, or no, in reſpect of us, (as there is to none a poſſibility, who are deſtitute of the gift) we caſt all our care, not upon mortifying and refraining our luſt; but upon the obſervance of the Symptoms of this gift, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral riſings and heights of our luſts, accordingly to ſhape to our ſelves that future condition of life, to which our preſent ſeems to lead us. And all this without cauſe, whereas we may make our ſelves what we are not; and God's providing a remedy for an innocent ſatisfying of that concupiſcence, which cannot (by our deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) otherwiſe be allayed, was by reaſon of our ordinary weakneſs, not of our abſolute neceſſity; to whom he (in ſome times) indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a facile changing alſo of thoſe to whome men were joyned: but it likewiſe not for their neceſſity, but for the <hi>hardneſs of their hearts.</hi> Matt. 19.8. —Whereas now it is a fruit of the Evangelical perfection, that husbands (by mutual conſent) do ſeparate from their wives (without taking others) for the Kingdom of God, (<hi>Lu.</hi> 18.29. compared 28.) always ſecure of the gift of continency from God, (if reſolute in their endeavours of preſerving it): Elſe this would be an act moſt unlawful, which our Saviour makes ſo heroical, and promiſeth to it ſo great a reward.</p>

                  <p>Out of the <hi>Canons</hi> then recited above you may obſerve, 1. That the Greek Church, who acknowledg and practiſe theſe <hi>Canons</hi> in this point to this day, allow indeed the uſe of their wives, except when they officiate, (but what if they officiate every day, as many Prieſts do?) to Prieſts married before Ordination, but not ſo to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; but permit not that any Ordained unmarried may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward marry at all. <hi>2ly.</hi> Again, That thoſe married perſons, who were to be made Presbyters in the Roman Church, and Biſhops in the Oriental, might not ſeparate from their wives without conſent, received from the wives before ſuch Ordination or Conſecration of them. <hi>3ly.</hi> That ſuch continency was annexed to Holy Orders only by Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, and was rather <hi>Lex Continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> than <hi>Votum.</hi> which therefore hath bin capable of many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, and the <hi>Conons</hi> about it ſomewhat differing; and the Clergy more reſtrained by ſome of them than by others. But this ſeems to be a received ground amongſt them all in thoſe primitive times, that Continency is a general gift, at leaſt in <hi>potentia remota, i.e.</hi> which is by God denied to none uſing the means, and rightly preparing himſelf for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Els how could they prudently make ſuch laws, ſtrictly prohibiting marriage for ſuch a number of men, involving alſo the Deacons, and Subdeacons, upon penalty of degradation from their office, (which laws you ſee, the Reformed, becauſe they hold continency a particular gift, only poſſible to ſome, generally decry.) How could they allow of a ſeparation (by conſent once given) of a man and his wife for ever, required, in the Roman Church, of all; in the Eaſtern, of Biſhops; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 Cor. 7.5? unleſs you will ſay, that the Church-Officers in time of Ordination could diſcern who had this gift, who not. Or, that there was no party coming to be ordained, or contenting to ſuch a ſeparation, but was able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern it in himſelf, and that not only for the preſent, but always for the future; and likewiſe that none would preſent himſelf, that knew he had it not.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106352:69"/>even their own times alſo a part of the <hi>laſt</hi> times, (ſee 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.17. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11.) and therefore, when they deſcribe ſuch wicked perſons, adviſing thoſe they writ to for the preſent to beware of them, to reſiſt them, to teach contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6.<hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14.—4.2. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.1.

And therefore whether the prophecy (eying thoſe times) is likely to mean them, [i. e. <hi>the aſſerters of marriage and meats to be in themſelves utterly unlawful and unclean,</hi>] or to mean the Fathers rather, their Antagoniſts in theſe points, I leave to the Readers judgment.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106352:73"/>*That of <hi>Obedience,</hi> provided, it be engaged only for things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, about which lawfulneſs, when any doubt happens, he is to be guided by the Church'es, not his private Superiors judgment: (Which I think, in no Monaſtical inſtitution that ever was, can be ſhewed to be peremptorily denied to any, for the ordinary plea of many of the Roman Doctors is contrary; namely, that no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority leſs than infallible (which Superiors are not) can oblige to abſolute obedience and ſubmiſſion to their judgment in matters credible or practicable in order to our ſalvation (See <hi>Notes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibity;</hi>) Tho thoſe who are under Authority are prudentially ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, rather to ſubmit in all things to their Superiors (moſt likely) better judgments, than (with very little ſign of humility) indulge their own; and cauſſeſly afflict their Society with appeals and conteſts:) Theſe two vows, I ſay, thus qualified, are not liable to any juſt exceptions. And indeed the former we ſee done frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongſt us, in many parting for ever with their eſtates (only what is neceſſary reſerved) to their Son: why not then to the poor? and the latter in Servants promiſing, or alſo ſwearing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Maſters; why not to a Spirtual Superior?</p>

For 1. are not moſt of our vows (yet theſe grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lawful) about things, which, as ſome way advantageous, yet, are not abſolutely neceſſary to our ſalvation? as the vowing, * of abſtinence from the further ule of ſome ſenſual, the lawful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, formerly tp us an occaſion of ſin; * of giving ſuch a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of alms (ſuppoſe half of our eſtates) to the poor, (ſuch a one was <hi>Ananias</hi> his vow, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. whoſe fault, ſo much aggravated by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſeems to be more in his keeping back part, after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting it to God, than in pretending, by a lye, to bring it all: ſee the inference ver. 3 <hi>But Peter</hi> &amp;c.) * of uſing every day two or three times of prayer extraordinary; * of not drinking wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of many former temptations by it to exceſs.

For which expreſſions if we make the vow of continency unlawful, why not the other? Now who is there that may not lawfully vow, to repent of his ſins, to believe in God to his lives end, to obſerve God's commands, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> (118. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 106.108. <hi>v.</hi>) yet as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nemo praeſumat viribus ſuis red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere quod voverit.

To which this further may be added: That Continency, as any other thing advantaging us in God's Service, from Vows receives a much higher value, which may invite us to ſuch pious engagements) than without it; whilſt it proceeds from an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction more confirmed and ſtedfaſt in good.

And very expedient doubtleſs it is (after ſome trial and experience of our having a reaſonable command over our ſelves, and of our not ſuffering a very tyrannical maſtery of our paſſions) to paſs a vow in ſuch matters to fortify our ſelves againſt temptations, and the mutability of our inclinations; by which the leſs former tye we have of our ſelves, the eaſilier we are ſeduced.

                  <p>As for thoſe places of the Apoſtle which are urged, againſt vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at leaſt before <hi>ſixty,</hi> or for leave given to marry, tho it be after vows, upon incontnency; [as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Let not a widow be taken into the number under</hi> 60 <hi>years old:</hi> —and 14. <hi>I will therefore, that the younger women marry</hi> &amp;c. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9. <hi>If they cannot contain let them marry:</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>I ſpeak not that I may cast a ſnare upon you.</hi>] In anſwer to them, I take this firſt for granted; that all thoſe (young or old) who have the power to be continent, may ſafely vow it; ſince the reaſon given by the Reformed, why it may not be vowed, is, becauſe it is a thing not in our power. Again, I ſay, that if theſe places prove, either that continency before 60. may not be vowed, or marrying after a vow may be lawful, upon this reaſon, becauſe ſome perſons before <hi>ſixty,</hi> and after vowing, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; then the Apoſtle will be made to contradict himſelf. For according to this he could not ſay of the Juniors, (whoſe particular gift of continency he could not know, but had rather reaſon to preſume, from the miſcarriage he ſaw in them, that they had it not,) that <hi>they had damnation,</hi> for marrying; or for not keeping their vow or promiſe to Chriſt, which they could not keep; but <hi>damnation,</hi> for making ſuch a vow, which they muſt neceſſarily break<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, <hi>Non eſt peccatum violare, quod ſervare impoſſibile est;</hi> and it was as lawful to break ſuch a vow, as unlawful to make it. But yet notwithſtanding this, the Apoſtle plainly ſaith, damnation they had for marrying, and for breaking this promiſe, not for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106352:74"/>it. I conclude therefore, that the Apoſtle's advice here of marriage is not * to Votaries, nor abſolutely to all other younger women: for ſo his <hi>volo juniores nubere</hi> here would be contrary to his <hi>volo omnes eſſe ſicut meipſum,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.7. and would lay an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation on all young folks to marry: But * to thoſe that are in ſuch a manner qualified, as thoſe were that miſcarried: <hi>ſo qualified;</hi> not from want of power from God to contain, but want of will, and of a ſtedfaſt purpoſe to make uſe of that power, (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.37.) which inſtability of the will, and pronenes to incontinency (that is in ſome much more than in others) eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ought well to examin before they vow; that ſo they may make uſe of the lawful remedy, which in the ſecond place God hath provided for it, namely marriage; if they do not aſpire to the higher cure thereof by prayer, and mortifications. See Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> in his Paraphraſe, expounding it thus, <hi>[That thoſe who have not attained to ſuch gravity of mind, and command over themſelves, do, in that caſe, betake themſelves to a married life:]</hi> —So, in that text, <hi>[if they cannot contain, let them marry.]</hi> (Where note, that our Tranſlation renders <gap reason="foreign">

                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:106352:75"/>the Apoſtle ſeems to preſcribe this age with reſpect: to their impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency then to get their living, and liableneſs to want, (ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 4, and 16.) and to their ſtaydneſs and gravity, [ſee <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14.] as much or more than to their continency, in which a leſſer age would have rendred them ſecure. But ſuppoſe the Apoſtle chiefly to have reference to this, yet was it not done as if any leſſer age hath not a power of continency; or experiencing their ability to live ſingle, might not alſo reſolve it: but becauſe the Church had not the ſame means to be aſſured of their inclinations, and was much concerned in her firſt growth, after the experience too of ſome miſcarriages, thus to prevent all ſcandal. But later Church, upon experience of the chaſt behaviour of ſuch perſons from the power of more diſcipline, due reſtraint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thought not her ſelf obliged by this rule fitted for the Apoſtles days.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106352:75"/>paſſion whatſoever: to which likewiſe one perſon (and in him one age of his life) may have yet a far greater pronity than another, by the greater heat of their conſtitution; natural impetuoſity of their paſſion; more liberal diet; much reſt and vacancy from imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; converſation amongſt tempting objects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that ſuch, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extream difficulty, cannot contain, as it alſo many times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens even to them after divorce, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> (who, all grant, have from God the power of containing, if they will uſe their beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors).

If they receive not, becauſe God gives not; <hi>Matt.</hi> 19.11. and if God gives not, becauſe they do not by prayer, and other means, prepare themſelves for it; it follows, the prime reaſon, why they receive not, is becauſe they are unmortified, or unprepared.

But <hi>3ly,</hi> in reſpect of the faculty it ſelf, and the uſing of it well, in our endeavors to attain ſuch a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106352:76"/>grace, tis true alſo, that our being willing to do a thing is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called God's gift; and there is nothing, of which we can ſay, tis our fault or infirmity that we do it not, but that we may as truly ſay, it is God's gift, if we do it. (See <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.23. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.1. <hi>Ex.</hi> 4.11. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.31.—10.15.—<hi>Ezr.</hi> 6.22. <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.11.) Therefore alſo this our deſiring ſuch a grace to be given us, or our entertaining ſuch a grace offered us, is alſo in ſome ſenſe another gift or grace of God to us, without which we ſhould not have poſſeſſed his other grace; and ſo, our own endeavour, as well as the grace we ſeek for, is all gift and grace, tho we ſhould go <hi>in infinitum;</hi> till we alſo find (as the moſt ordinary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the School is) that the firſt motion of the will to embrace God's grace is alſo the grace, gift, or work of God in us: els if this motion of the will were from it ſelf, in any ſenſe contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct to that of being from God, then there would be ſome good in us, not from God; then ſomething, which we had not received; and ſo, place for merit, and boaſting; contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2, 4. —3.17. But I conceive, tis not ſaid of theſe firſt gifts of God, (<hi>i.e.</hi> of his firſt excitings of the will; his both preventing and aſſiſting aids and helps of the will, in its uſing the means to attain his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and richer, habitual, and inherent graces,) that <hi>non omnibus data ſunt;</hi> but of thoſe other ſecond graces, which are given but to few, becauſe the means, and his former commoner aids are uſed by few: of which it is ſaid, that, only <hi>to him that hath, ſhall be given.</hi> Of thoſe firſt aids therefore we may ſafely ſay, that they are ſo far common to all, (to whom is come the ſound of the Goſpel, and who ſhall be judged at the laſt day by the Goſpel) that it is their fault, in any duties, which are abſolutely command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and their defect, in any counſels of perfection, if they, by not making uſe of them, come ſhort of ſuch duty or perfection; and, that any thing being thus ſaid to be God's gift hinders not, but that it likewiſe may be ſaid alſo to be in man's power, (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a power, in man, but, from God,) as long as the tender of ſuch a gift is made to him, and ability alſo to acquire it given to him. But of this more in my <hi>Notes of Grace.</hi> Yet ſince, there are ſome that allow not the means to attain faith, or other duties command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, common to all to whom the Goſpel is preached, (therefore <hi>P. Martyr,</hi> 3. <hi>claſſ.</hi> 7. <hi>c. Commun. locorum.</hi> argues thus: <hi>Magis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deretur debere commune eſſe omnibus hominibus donum efficacis vocatic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis ad ſidem in Chriſtum, quam donum ad Coelibatum. —Sed inter illos qui eandem praedicationem audiunt, non omnes a Deo trahuntur.</hi> Where he quotes Jo. 6.44. <hi>Nemo venit ad me:</hi>) Let but ſo much be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106352:77"/>granted from them, of the means to attain continency, as is, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain faith; and this will ſerve our turn, without reaſoning the point any further in this place; for then fee what will follow §. 23. In granting therefore, that the uſing of the means alſo to obtain graces from God is the gift of God; yet we affirm, that it is only by their own default (for which ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.57. <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.21. <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.34. <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.4. —8.10.) if in things abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely commanded, and their own defect, if in things recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their greater perfection, that ſuch do not uſe the means, and that they may uſe them if they will. Becauſe theſe muſt conſiſt together, <hi>i.e.</hi> * that <hi>we can do no good</hi> (ſmall or great) <hi>but from God;</hi> and * that <hi>we have free-will to do good,</hi> and if we do not good, tis by our own default; and * that when we do any good, tis not without our own endeavour. Els we ſhould be free from ſin in not obſerving the divine exhortations; and there would be no vice, nor virtue; and conſequently no (juſt) puniſhment, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. See concerning this S. <hi>Auſtin, De Gratia &amp; libero Arbitrio</hi> 4. <hi>cap. Nunquid non liberum arbitrium</hi> Timothei <hi>eſt exhortatus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolus, dicens,</hi> Contine teipſum? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.23. —<hi>Et in hac re po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testatem voluntatis oſtendit, ubi ait,</hi> Non habens neceſſitatem; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatem autem habens ſuae voluntatis, ut ſervet virginem ſuam. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.37. <hi>Et tamen non omnes capiunt verbum hoc, ſed quibus da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt,</hi> &amp;c. —<hi>Itaque ut hoc verbum, quod non ab omnibus capitur, ab aliquibus capiatur, &amp; Dei donum eſt, &amp; liberum arbitrium</hi> &amp;c. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will this be ſufficient to hinder a vow, becauſe it is only of God's gift (that we are willing to uſe the means) to keep and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil it. For alſo we cannot do any thing he commands, unles he gives us the will; and yet may we vow to do any thing he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106352:77"/>over our ſelves, to overmaſter us; and our good reſolution become a ſnare to us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.35. <hi>beginning to build, and not able to finiſh.</hi> In which S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s warineſs may be a ſufficient precedent to ours; who, * finding the young widows after ſuch purpoſes (by their own fault indeed) remarrying, and * conſidering the greatneſs of internal and external temptations incident to youth, (thro the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent diſcipline the infancy of the Church was then capable of, not ſo reſtrained as latter times have ſince provided,) ordered that none under <hi>ſixty</hi> ſhould be admitted into publick ſervice upon ſuch ſtrict bonds and obligations. And indeed in the buſineſs of continency, in which ſome degree of burning is in the moſt pure, it is very hard, till long experience hath as it were aſſured us, at any one time exactly to meaſure our own ſtrength, conſtancy, and ſtedfaſtneſs, whether we ſhall be able to contain for the time to come; and, by the intervening of new temptations <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (unleſs we reſolve wholly to ſhut up our ſelves from them) our future, is not eaſily judged by our preſent, complexion. And as, when I look at the heavenlineſs of a ſingle life, I would adviſe all men to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain; ſo when at the great difficulty of ſuch a purity, as ſhall not be contaminated with one uncleanneſs, than which the Apoſtle adviſeth rather to marry, I would counſel all men to marry; [See <hi>Conf.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> how S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> complains of his parents not prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by marriage the many exorbitancies of his wanton youth:] ſeeing the ſingle perſon much hazards a great ſin, whilſt he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts as great a glory.

Which if the Apoſtle ſaw fitting in the miniſtring <hi>widows,</hi> the <hi>Deaconeſſes, (Rom. 16.1.) how much more is it in the Clergy?
